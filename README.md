Simulate the DOS sort command in Java.
Note: in order to correctly simulate the redirection operators < and >, the Java command line arguments have to be surrounded by double quotes.

In order to run this program, you need to call the java utility along with the necessary classpath, the class name and the desired arguments.
For example:

java -classpath dos_sort_java\bin;dos_sort_java\lib\commons-lang3-3.4.jar simulating.DosSort "<" sortable.txt ">" output.txt
